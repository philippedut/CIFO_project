    "# Fantasy Sports League Optimizer: A Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements a genetic algorithm to solve a fantasy sports league optimization problem. I'll explain the implementation in detail to prepare you for defending it, focusing on the algorithm design, implementation choices, and how each component works together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem involves distributing football (soccer) players across teams to create a balanced league while maintaining certain constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Team Structure**: Each team must have exactly 1 goalkeeper (GK), 2 defenders (DEF), 2 midfielders (MID), and 2 forwards (FWD).\n",
    "2. **Budget Constraint**: Each team has a salary cap of 750 million euros.\n",
    "3. **Optimization Goal**: The main objective is to create balanced teams, where the average skill rating of players is roughly the same across all teams. This is measured by minimizing the standard deviation of the average skill ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Player Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The Player class represents individual players with their attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Player:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, id, name, position, skill, salary):\n",
    "        self.id = id\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.position = position  # GK, DEF, MID, or FWD\n",
    "        self.skill = skill        # Player's skill rating\n",
    "        self.salary = salary      # Player's salary in million euros\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This class simply encapsulates player information and doesn't contain complex methods, following good object-oriented design principles by keeping the class focused on a single responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Team Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The Team class represents a team in the league:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Team:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, team_id):\n",
    "        self.id = team_id\n",
    "        self.players = []\n",
    "        self.budget_limit = BUDGET_LIMIT  # 750 million euros\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This class has several important methods:\n",
    "- `add_player()`: Adds a player to the team\n",
    "- `get_total_salary()`: Calculates the total salary of all players\n",
    "- `get_avg_skill()`: Calculates the average skill rating of the team\n",
    "- `is_within_budget()`: Checks if the team respects the budget constraint\n",
    "- `has_valid_formation()`: Verifies that the team has the required formation (1 GK, 2 DEF, 2 MID, 2 FWD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `has_valid_formation()` method is crucial as it enforces one of the main constraints of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def has_valid_formation(self):\n",
    "    pos_count = {'GK': 0, 'DEF': 0, 'MID': 0, 'FWD': 0}\n",
    "    for player in self.players:\n",
    "        pos_count[player.position] = pos_count.get(player.position, 0) + 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return pos_count.get('GK', 0) == 1 and pos_count.get('DEF', 0) == 2 and \\\n",
    "           pos_count.get('MID', 0) == 2 and pos_count.get('FWD', 0) == 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. League Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The League class represents a complete league configuration (a solution candidate):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class League:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, num_teams=NUM_TEAMS):\n",
    "        self.teams = [Team(i) for i in range(num_teams)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key methods include:\n",
    "- `get_avg_skills()`: Returns a list of average skill ratings for each team\n",
    "- `get_skill_std_dev()`: Calculates the standard deviation of average skill ratings across teams\n",
    "- `is_valid()`: Checks if the league configuration is valid (all teams have valid formations and stay within budget)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_skill_std_dev()` method is particularly important as it computes the main optimization objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_skill_std_dev(self):\n",
    "    avg_skills = self.get_avg_skills()\n",
    "    return np.std(avg_skills)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Genetic Algorithm Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. SelectionMethods Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class implements two selection methods for the genetic algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tournament Selection\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@staticmethod\n",
    "def tournament_selection(population, fitness_func, tournament_size=3):\n",
    "    tournament = random.sample(population, tournament_size)\n",
    "    return min(tournament, key=fitness_func)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tournament selection works by:\n",
    "1. Randomly selecting a subset of individuals (tournament_size = 3 by default)\n",
    "2. Choosing the best individual from that subset based on fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "This method provides selection pressure while still maintaining diversity in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Roulette Wheel Selection\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@staticmethod\n",
    "def roulette_wheel_selection(population, fitness_func):\n",
    "    fitnesses = [fitness_func(individual) for individual in population]\n",
    "    transformed_fitnesses = [1.0 / (f + 0.01) for f in fitnesses]\n",
    "    total_fitness = sum(transformed_fitnesses)\n",
    "    probabilities = [f / total_fitness for f in transformed_fitnesses]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    r = random.random()\n",
    "    cumulative_prob = 0\n",
    "    for i, prob in enumerate(probabilities):\n",
    "        cumulative_prob += prob\n",
    "        if r <= cumulative_prob:\n",
    "            return population[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Roulette wheel selection:\n",
    "1. Assigns selection probability proportional to fitness\n",
    "2. Since this is a minimization problem (lower standard deviation is better), it transforms the fitness values using the reciprocal (1/fitness)\n",
    "3. Selects individuals with probability proportional to their transformed fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. CrossoverMethods Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class implements two crossover operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Team-based Crossover\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@staticmethod\n",
    "def team_based_crossover(parent1, parent2, player_count):\n",

    "            for player in parent1.teams[i].players:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    return child\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This crossover:\n",
    "1. For each team position, randomly selects the entire team from either parent1 or parent2\n",
    "2. Checks if the resulting child is valid (no duplicate players, all players assigned)\n",
    "3. Returns None if the child is invalid, signaling that a new individual should be created\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Position-based Crossover\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@staticmethod\n",
    "def position_based_crossover(parent1, parent2, player_count):\n",

    "### 3. MutationMethods Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class implements three mutation operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Swap Mutation\n",

    "                self.best_solution = individual\n",
    "        \n",
    "        self.fitness_history.append(self.best_fitness)\n",

    "This method:\n",
    "1. Initializes a random population\n",
    "2. Runs for a specified number of generations\n",
    "3. Uses elitism to keep the best solution\n",
    "4. Creates the rest of the population through:\n",
    "   - Selection: Alternating between tournament and roulette wheel selection\n",
    "   - Crossover: Alternating between team-based and position-based crossover\n",
    "   - Mutation: Applying one of three mutation operators with different probabilities\n",
    "5. Updates the best solution found so far\n",
    "6. Returns the best solution after completing all generations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The code includes a `SolutionAnalyzer` class to evaluate and visualize the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SolutionAnalyzer:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def analyze_solution(league):\n",
    "        # Print detailed information about the solution\n",
    "        \n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def export_solution_to_csv(league, filename):\n",
    "        # Export the league solution to a CSV file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GeneticAlgorithm` class also includes a `plot_fitness_history()` method that visualizes the improvement of the best solution over generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is organized to run in a Jupyter notebook with distinct execution steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Import libraries, define constants, and implement classes\n",
    "2. **Data Loading**: Load player data from the CSV file\n",
    "3. **Optimization**: Run the genetic algorithm\n",
    "4. **Analysis**: Visualize results and analyze the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features to Highlight During Defense\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constraint Handling**: The code effectively handles hard constraints (team formation, salary cap) through penalties in the fitness function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fitness Function Design**: The fitness function combines multiple objectives:\n",
    "   - Primary: Minimizing the standard deviation of team skill ratings\n",
    "   - Secondary: Staying within budget constraints\n",
    "   - Tertiary: Avoiding solutions too close to the budget limit\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Operators**: The code implements:\n",
    "   - 2 selection methods (tournament and roulette wheel)\n",
    "   - 2 crossover operators (team-based and position-based)\n",
    "   - 3 mutation operators (swap, position shuffle, and scramble)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modular Design**: The code follows good object-oriented design principles with clear separation of concerns:\n",
    "   - Data structures (Player, Team, League)\n",
    "   - Genetic operators (Selection, Crossover, Mutation)\n",
    "   - Analysis and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Elitism**: The algorithm preserves the best solution in each generation, ensuring that the solution quality never decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling**: The code checks for invalid offspring from crossover operations and replaces them with random individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Dynamic Operator Selection**: The algorithm dynamically alternates between different selection and crossover methods and applies different mutation operators with varying probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aligns well with the genetic algorithm theory presented in the textbook by Leonardo Vanneschi and Sara Silva, particularly the concepts of selection pressure, genetic diversity, and constraint handling."
