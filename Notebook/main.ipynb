    "## **Project Description**\n",
    "This project focuses on optimizing team assignments in a fantasy sports league while ensuring a balanced distribution of talent and adherence to salary constraints. Given a dataset of players with attributes such as skill rating, cost, and position, we aim to assign them to five teams while following strict constraints and achieving a balanced league.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Constraints**\n",
    "- Each team must consist of:\n",
    "  - 1 Goalkeeper (GK)  \n",
    "  - 2 Defenders (DEF)  \n",
    "  - 2 Midfielders (MID)  \n",
    "  - 2 Forwards (FWD)  \n",
    "- Each player is assigned to exactly one team.  \n",
    "- No team may exceed a total budget of **750 million â‚¬**.  \n",
    "- The standard deviation of the average skill rating of all teams should be minimized to ensure fairness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objective**\n",
    "To generate a valid league configuration that follows all constraints and ensures that teams have a similar overall skill level, measured by the standard deviation of their average skill ratings.\n",
