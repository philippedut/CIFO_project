# **Fantasy Sports League Optimization**

## **Project Description**
This project focuses on optimizing team assignments in a fantasy sports league while ensuring a balanced distribution of talent and adherence to salary constraints. Given a dataset of players with attributes such as skill rating, cost, and position, we aim to assign them to five teams while following strict constraints and achieving a balanced league.

## **Constraints**
- Each team must consist of:
  - 1 Goalkeeper (GK)  
  - 2 Defenders (DEF)  
  - 2 Midfielders (MID)  
  - 2 Forwards (FWD)  
- Each player is assigned to exactly one team.  
- No team may exceed a total budget of **750 million â‚¬**.  
- The standard deviation of the average skill rating of all teams should be minimized to ensure fairness.  

## **Objective**
To generate a valid league configuration that follows all constraints and ensures that teams have a similar overall skill level, measured by the standard deviation of their average skill ratings.
